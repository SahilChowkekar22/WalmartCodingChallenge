# Walmart Coding Challenge â€“ iOS App

This is an iOS application which embraces modern iOS development practices and leverages a clean architecture to ensure a scalable, maintainable, and testable codebase.

---

##  Project Structure

The project follows a modular structure inspired by Clean Architecture principles:

- **Views** â€“ SwiftUI components and screen layouts
- **ViewModel** â€“ Business logic and data transformation for UI
- **NetworkManager** â€“ Handles all API interactions and networking logic
- **Repository** â€“ Abstraction layer between data sources and ViewModels
- **Model** â€“ Swift data models for parsing and managing data
- **Tests** â€“ Includes Unit and UI tests to ensure functionality

---

## Architecture

The app is built using the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture pattern:

- Clear separation of concerns
- Improved testability and modularity
- Seamless data binding between View and ViewModel using `@Published` properties

---

## Features

-  SwiftUI-based modern user interface
-  Clean and scalable MVVM architecture
-  Asynchronous network layer with Combine
-  Modular Repository pattern
-  Includes Unit Tests and UI Tests for validation
